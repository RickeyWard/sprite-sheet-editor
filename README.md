## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Experiment

**This entire project was built using only AI prompting** through Cursor IDE with Claude Sonnet 4.0. No traditional coding was performed - every line of code, styling, and feature was generated through conversational AI assistance. This represents an experiment to understand the current state of AI-assisted development and explore what's possible when achieving real-world goals through pure AI collaboration.

The development process involved:
- Iterative feature requests through natural language
- Real-time problem-solving and debugging via AI conversation  
- UI/UX refinements through descriptive feedback
- Code architecture decisions guided by AI recommendations

This project serves as both a functional tool and a case study in AI-driven software development.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality

```

## üìù Usage

1. **Import Sprites** - Drag image files into the upload area
2. **Configure Packing** - Choose your preferred settings:
   - Select sprite dimension handling (original vs trimmed)
   - Adjust spacing and padding
   - Enable power-of-2 dimensions if needed
3. **Create Animations** (optional) - Group related sprites into sequences
4. **Preview** - Use zoom and pan to inspect your sprite sheet
5. **Export** - Download the packed sprite sheet and JSON metadata

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Modern UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling
- **Canvas API** - Image processing and rendering
- **React Dropzone** - File upload handling
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with flexbox/grid

## üìä Packing Algorithms

The editor implements efficient bin-packing algorithms to minimize texture size while maximizing sprite density. Multiple strategies ensure optimal results for different sprite collections.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Game Development** - Create texture atlases for PixiJS games
- **Animation Production** - Pack sprite sequences efficiently
- **Asset Optimization** - Reduce texture memory usage
- **Prototyping** - Quickly test sprite arrangements
